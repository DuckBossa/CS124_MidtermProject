Memento and Mediator Design Patterns

Listeners.java contains the first versions of the listeners used in the system. This is unupdated.
All latest versions are in the classes where the listeners are used.

Classes.java contains the skeleton version of some of the classes used in the system.
Finals versions are completely different.

Method.java contains the first version of the showInfo method of the Main class.
The used version is slightly different.

Test.java is just a tester for the DB_Mediator.java class before it was integrated into the system.

How to Run:
- run the .sql script in MySQL.
- input your MySQL login credentials in the DB_Mediator.java file.
- compile
- run Main.java, make sure the .jar file for the Database Library is included in your classpath.
